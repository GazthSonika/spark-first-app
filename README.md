# spark-first-app
Just Learning java, hoping that spark is the same for java what sinatra is for ruby or silex is for php

GOAL
 - simple rest app serving some info with 3td party api
 - implementation of sql and nosql database
 - auth implementation
 - docker
 - spark
 - know beter the java style
 
 
 
 In order to run it needs the api key from apixu and set as env APIXU_KEY latter i'll write small DI and Config class to handle stuff like that
